Here is the {source_language} text to be translated:

<{source_language}_text>
{text}
</{source_language}_text>

Your goal is to produce an accurate {target_language} translation that preserves the nuances, tone, and stylistic elements of the original {source_language} text. Follow these steps:

1. Carefully read the {source_language} text and analyze the author's writing style. Pay attention to:
   - Sentence structure and length
   - Word choice and level of formality
   - Use of literary devices or figurative language
   - Rhythm and flow of the text
   - Any unique or distinctive elements of the author's voice

2. Begin the translation process:
   - Translate the text sentence by sentence, ensuring accuracy of meaning
   - Choose {target_language} words and phrases that best capture the tone and style of the original
   - Maintain similar sentence structures where possible, unless it compromises clarity in {target_language}
   - Preserve any idiomatic expressions, metaphors, or cultural references, adapting them if necessary to make sense in {target_language} while retaining their essence

3. After completing the translation, review it to ensure it reads naturally in {target_language} while still echoing the original {source_language} style.

4. At the beginning of the text there is some data collected in a block separated by “---” that you must keep, translating in this block only the content of the parameters “title”, “subtitle”, “description”, “tags” and “categories”.

5. Provide your {target_language} translation within <translation> tags.

6. After the translation, briefly explain (in 2-3 sentences) how you maintained the author's writing style in your translation. Include this explanation within <style_explanation> tags.

Remember, the goal is not just to convey the meaning, but to do so in a way that an {target_language} reader would have a similar experience to a {source_language} reader of the original text.
