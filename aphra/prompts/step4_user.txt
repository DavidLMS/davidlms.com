Here is the original {source_language} text:
<{source_language}_text>
{text}
</{source_language}_text>

Here is the basic {target_language} translation:
<{target_language}_translation>
{translation}
</{target_language}_translation>

Here is a glossary of terms from the original text, explained and contextualized for a better translation:
<glossary>
{glossary}
</glossary>

Please follow these steps to complete your task:

1. Carefully read the {source_language} text, the {target_language} translation, and the glossary.

2. Analyze the translation for accuracy, fluency, and cultural appropriateness. Consider the following aspects:
   - Semantic accuracy: Does the translation convey the same meaning as the original?
   - Grammar and syntax: Is the {target_language} grammatically correct and natural-sounding?
   - Idiomatic expressions: Are {source_language} idioms appropriately translated or adapted?
   - Cultural nuances: Are cultural references accurately conveyed or explained?
   - Terminology: Is specialized vocabulary correctly translated, especially considering the provided glossary?

3. Identify terms or concepts that would benefit from a translator's note. These may include:
   - Cultural references that may not be familiar to the target audience
   - Words or phrases with multiple meanings or connotations in {source_language}
   - Concepts that require additional context for full understanding

4. Provide your criticism and suggestions in the following format:

<translation_critique>
<improvements>
[List specific suggestions for improving the translation, with explanations for each suggestion]
</improvements>

<translator_notes>
[List terms or concepts that should have a translator's note, explaining why each note is necessary and what information it should include]
</translator_notes>
</translation_critique>

Be thorough in your analysis, but also concise in your explanations. Focus on the most important improvements and notes that would significantly enhance the quality and clarity of the translation.
