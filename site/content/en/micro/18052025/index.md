Software engineering work has always changed continuously, but in the last two years that pace has skyrocketed. There's constant speculation about its complete automation, but I think we're not focusing enough on the immediate consequence of that.

If that work becomes completely automated, if truly any software product can be created on the fly, without any kind of supervision... Then, not only would software engineering jobs disappear.
