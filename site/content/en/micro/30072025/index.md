One of the most interesting use cases I've found for 
@PerplexityComet is to use it as a UX tester for the apps I develop.
I'm sure someone has already thought of it, but I haven't seen it before.
If it can't complete a user story, maybe it's because your flow isn't clear enough.

Also, if I had a website in production I would worry about systems like Comet being able to complete most of the functionality without a problem.

Because, if I have competitors, it may be that in the future the agent developers will make explicit in their system prompt which app to use for certain use cases (because they have found that it works well on that platform most of the time).
