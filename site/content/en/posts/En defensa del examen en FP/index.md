**Important**: Translated automatically from Spanish by [🌐💬 Aphra 1.0.0](https://github.com/DavidLMS/aphra)

This is a **personal reflection** following the reading of Rafael Delgado Valdivielso's article: [NO MORE EXAMS, PLEASE. WE LIVE IN THE 21ST CENTURY](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uYWwyALHyQZQajlpWlkW9wv3UFtkW4Dl/view). It's worth pausing here to read his article instead.

I believe that exams are a **fundamental** tool for learning, as our educational system is currently structured, for several reasons:

* A good portion of students wouldn't dedicate time to review[^1] if they didn't know they would face an exam at some point.
* The exam indicates areas for improvement for the learner.
* If appropriate feedback[^2] is given at the right time, it serves not only to evaluate but also to facilitate learning.
* In any subject, as one progresses, it's assumed that previous content has been understood. The exam allows for the detection of an erroneously acquired concept, making it possible to **understand more complex ones**.

This doesn't mean I'm against what's explained in the article; I'm **very much in favor** of ending exams as understood in the way described there, transitioning towards tests that resemble what can be found in a work environment. But for me, that's also an **exam**; we shouldn't demonize the word.

Two proposals are presented: a new system without exams and a less radical alternative. I wish we could apply that new system, but right now it seems utopian to me. Perhaps either the system or my opinion will change over time. So I want to focus on thinking about how I can apply something to my classroom **tomorrow**.

In my opinion, what are the biggest problems with an exam (understood as a test of competencies[^3], using necessary resources, rather than purely testing memorization) ? **The date and the subsequent correction**. The date, due to the pressure it exerts and the students' habit of leaving everything to the last minute. The subsequent correction, due to the workload it requires for the student to then be left with just the numerical grade[^4], without learning from mistakes. My proposal based on what I've read? **Eliminate both**.

What if...

...we conduct tests any day **without prior notice**?

...we do it **frequently** (weekly at minimum)?

...we decide in each one the criteria[^5] we're going to evaluate and note at that moment **in a binary way** who achieves it and who doesn't? (Without prejudice to being able to rectify a criterion already assessed for a person who now demonstrates knowing how to do something they didn't before)

...we make them **individual or team-based** (dividing the task to achieve accurate observation)?

My intention is to remove that pressure from students, of risking it all on one day and at one time, delaying review until the hours immediately before (with luck) and making **the exceptional become the habitual**.

In the end, a grade has to be given, and a pass or fail[^6] isn't enough, so **we'll have to think** about how it's calculated. We'll also have to think about what we do to support recovery plans[^7]. And, in these times, what would happen if we had to do it remotely.

Shall we **debate**? Do you have a proposal? **Write to me**.

Let's keep talking.

[^1]: "Repaso" in Spanish refers to the process of reviewing or revising previously learned material, which is an essential part of the Spanish educational system.

[^2]: "Retroalimentación" is the Spanish term for "feedback" in educational contexts, emphasizing its importance in the learning process in Spanish-speaking countries.

[^3]: "Pruebas de competencias" are competency tests used to assess students' skills and knowledge, often used for university admissions in Spain.

[^4]: "Calificación numérica" refers to the numerical grading system used in Spain, typically on a scale of 0-10, and is an important aspect of the educational context.

[^5]: "Criterios de evaluación" are the assessment criteria used in Spanish education, outlining their role in determining student performance.

[^6]: "Apto o no apto" is a pass/fail grading system used in some Spanish educational contexts, contrasting with the more common numerical grading system.

[^7]: "Planes de recuperación" are recovery or catch-up plans used in Spanish education.
