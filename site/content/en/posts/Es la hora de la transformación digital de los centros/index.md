**Important**: Translated automatically from Spanish by [游깷游눫 Aphra 1.0.0](https://github.com/DavidLMS/aphra)

I have long envied [Estonia's digital administration](https://elpais.com/elpais/2018/04/05/eps/1522927807_984041.html)[^1]. Although, for many reasons, [Spain cannot be compared](https://analiticapublica.es/espana-no-es-estonia/), it is true that the technology is there and is **underutilized**.

Of course, a **digital transformation**[^2] needs time... Until an epidemic arrives. Suddenly, many procedures that required going to a physical office can now be done from home. Restaurants have a QR code to read their menu. The doctor can attend to you through a phone call and prescribe what you need. Practically overnight. Has it suddenly become less complicated to implement?

Regardless, both then and now, we must consider the digital transformation of our educational institutions[^3]. **Think and act**. Moreover, at all levels: **administrative, pedagogical, and managerial**.

It's not at all about making the service less human. On the contrary, it's about **making it more so**. It's about digitizing and automating all those tasks that take time away from the most important tasks, which are the human ones.

It's about freeing administrative staff from dealing with physical papers (which is also very unecological), dedicating the least possible time to repetitive tasks such as managing admissions and enrollments, and having availability to continue optimizing processes and provide excellent **personalized attention** to more specific and less common needs.

It's about minimizing the time teachers spend on purely bureaucratic documentation that doesn't have a positive impact on their students' education and more on developing **quality** teaching material adapted to their group, less time grading and more giving **appropriate feedback**[^4], and less time in meetings that are mere formalities and more **coordinating horizontally**[^5] to carry out new educational proposals.

It's about management teams being able to effectively manage their assets, **detect needs** more quickly with objective data, have **exhaustive control** of incidents, and, most importantly, develop a **knowledge management**[^6] model for the center that is scalable and easily **transferable**[^7] to future team members.

Time is not on our side. Either we take advantage of technology to make the most of our time, or **our time will pass**.

Let the countdown begin[^8].

[^1]: This refers to Estonia's e-Estonia system, a pioneering model of digital governance globally recognized for its efficiency and innovation.

[^2]: Digital transformation refers to the integration of digital technology into all areas of an organization, fundamentally changing how it operates and delivers value.

[^3]: "Centros educativos" encompasses various types of educational institutions, including schools, colleges, and universities.

[^4]: "Retroalimentaci칩n adecuada" refers to constructive feedback in an educational context, emphasizing its importance in the Spanish education system.

[^5]: "Coordin치ndose horizontalmente" refers to coordination across departments or levels within an organization, particularly in educational institutions.

[^6]: "Gesti칩n del conocimiento" refers to the process of creating, sharing, using, and managing an organization's knowledge and information.

[^7]: "Trasladable" in this context means transferable or applicable across different situations or contexts.

[^8]: "Comienza la cuenta atr치s" is an idiomatic phrase used to create a sense of urgency or anticipation, similar to "The countdown begins" in English.
