**Important**: Translated automatically from Spanish by [游깷游눫 Aphra 1.0.0](https://github.com/DavidLMS/aphra)

I've been pondering for a while on how to improve the **effectiveness of learning** in my classes. Lately, I've been reading quite a bit about strategies supported by **cognitive psychology**[^1] research, such as spaced learning[^2] or the benefits of formative assessment[^3]. I think that if I want to get results, it's not enough to keep these in mind for a single activity; they need to be **integrated** into the subject I teach. They must be reflected, from the outset, in the **teaching program**[^4].

Until now, I've structured each teaching unit[^5] with the aim of working on one or two learning outcomes within it. I think it's the most **comfortable** approach for students, as they **master the content units sequentially**. I always end up integrating them into some practices or projects, and I usually find myself realizing that they **don't remember as well** as I'd like everything they should about the **previously** mastered outcomes.

I teach classes most of the time in an Intermediate Vocational Training Program[^6], observing that the students' strategy tends to be more focused **on passing than on learning**. This clashes head-on with reality, as passing serves no purpose when, at the end of the course, they should be able to successfully perform in a **job position**.

Therefore, I need a program that has the following **characteristics**:
* Each learning outcome is worked on for **enough time** to make a quality formative assessment.
* **Content is revisited and expanded upon** in successive evaluations enough to apply spaced review.
* Knowledge is tested in **different areas** to produce meaningful learning[^7] and increase the likelihood of transfer to a real environment.

I'm going to opt for starting to prepare a **spiral teaching program**. This means that, instead of working on learning outcomes in **isolated** blocks, I'm going to **pursue them all** from the beginning, starting from the **basics** of each one and climbing steps towards an increasingly **complex and holistic** understanding.

I believe the Network Services module of 2nd SMR[^8] is the one that can be **most easily** adapted to this type of programming, so it will be my **starting point** in this paradigm shift.

**Will you join me?**

Want to know more about **spaced review**? This website explains it spectacularly: [How to Remember Anything Forever-ish](https://ncase.me/remember/)

Don't know about **formative assessment**? This video explains it without explaining it: [Austin's Butterfly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqh1MRWZjms)

Do you have **experience** with these types of programs and approaches? **Write to me**.

PS: The nomenclature used in this entry corresponds to Vocational Training, but what I'm talking about can be applied to other educational stages.

[^1]: "Psicolog칤a cognitiva" is the Spanish term for cognitive psychology, which studies mental processes such as perception, memory, and problem-solving.

[^2]: "Aprendizaje espaciado" (spaced learning) is a cognitive learning technique where learning events are spaced out in time to improve retention and memory.

[^3]: "Evaluaci칩n formativa" (formative assessment) is an ongoing process of monitoring student learning to provide continuous feedback and improve both teaching and learning.

[^4]: "Programaci칩n did치ctica" refers to a comprehensive educational planning process in Spanish-speaking countries, including curriculum design and instructional strategies.

[^5]: "Unidad did치ctica" (teaching unit) is a structured set of learning activities designed to achieve specific educational goals and objectives.

[^6]: "Ciclo Formativo de Grado Medio" is a specific level of vocational education in Spain, equivalent to an intermediate-level vocational qualification.

[^7]: "Aprendizaje significativo" (meaningful learning) is a process that involves connecting new knowledge with existing understanding, emphasizing the student's active role in learning.

[^8]: "Servicios en Red de 2췈SMR" refers to a specific networking services module in the second year of a Systems and Networks Maintenance vocational program in Spain.
