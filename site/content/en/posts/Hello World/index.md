I've been considering starting a personal blog for some time now.

However, I wanted to do it right, taking my time. Perhaps set up a WordPress[^1] site, opt for an economical and fast hosting service, choose a good theme, plan the sections...

Today I read an [article](https://www.genbeta.com/desarrollo/como-publicar-web-gratis-usando-netlify-github) that dispelled my doubts. It's far from perfect, but it's up and running. An account on [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)[^2], a repository on [Github](https://github.com), the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)[^3] framework, a simple [theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/bilberry-hugo-theme/), a custom domain for 9 euros a year... and voil√†! It's here. Fast and economical. With HTTPS, CDN[^4], and easily updatable using Markdown[^5]. For the first post, an image from [stories](https://stories.freepik.com).

This blog has two personal goals. The first, to improve my writing. The second, to force myself to capture ideas and reflect. To pause and reflect every now and then. Because sometimes we rush around aimlessly.

If you've made it this far, **welcome**.
