**Important**: Translated automatically from Spanish by [🌐💬 Aphra 1.0.0](https://github.com/DavidLMS/aphra)

**Envision** a platform where teachers interested in participating in educational research can register, indicating the subjects or modules[^1] they teach and other relevant information, such as their school's geographical location.

**Envision** that researchers can filter a search using this data and send a message requesting collaboration in the research they want to conduct, indicating: what hypotheses they wish to put to the test, what they ask of collaborators, and what they offer in return.

**Envision** that this platform is organized by fields of study, with a section linking to new education research articles of interest for the specific specialty.

**Envision** that these articles have linked profiles of the teachers who have collaborated on them, with these articles also appearing on the teacher's profile following a two-way link.

These are just ideas I've been toying with[^2]. If anyone knows of a software, preferably open source[^3] and with the possibility of installation on one's own server (self-hosted)[^4], **that is more or less ready for these use cases[^5]**, I kindly ask them to contact me.

Let's continue to explore these possibilities.

[^1]: In the Spanish education system, "módulos" refers to specific units or components of a course.

[^2]: "Imaginaciones mías" in Spanish represents personal, conceptual ideas that go beyond simple imaginings.

[^3]: Open-source software refers to computer programs whose source code is freely accessible for use, modification, and distribution.

[^4]: Self-hosted installation involves setting up and running software on one's own server, providing greater control over data and infrastructure.

[^5]: In software development, "use cases" describe how a user interacts with a system to achieve a specific goal.
