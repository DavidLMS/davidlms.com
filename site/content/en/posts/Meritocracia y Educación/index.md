**Important**: Translated automatically from Spanish by [üåêüí¨ Aphra 1.0.0](https://github.com/DavidLMS/aphra)

We're all running the same race of life[^1]. The only difference is that we start from different starting points.

Different starting points? Don't we all have the same opportunities? If I put in the same effort as someone else, shouldn't I have the same advantages?
Toby Morris explains it perfectly in [this story](https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/the-wireless/373065/the-pencilsword-on-a-plate), which you can find translated into Spanish [here](https://marcianosmx.com/en-bandeja-de-plata-una-historia-sobre-los-privilegios/).

What you might not have stopped to consider is that Richard isn't wrong. According to his personal experience, his reality, the only key to reaching professional success is effort. Credit where credit is due; he has taken advantage of the opportunities he had. He's simply not aware that, depending on the socioeconomic context you're born into, your path is either smoother or rougher[^2]. He can simply run at a good pace to meet his goal. Paula has to constantly push herself to run better and race more intensely.

This is why we see some statements from people with a certain economic or power status (they often correlate) and it seems to us that they live in a parallel reality[^3]. Are they deceiving us or are they simply unable to see reality? Paul Piff talks about this in [this TED talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/paul_piff_does_money_make_you_mean/transcript?language=es), and it's very well exemplified in the experience with the Monopoly game.

We don't live in a true meritocracy[^4], although there are certain interests in making us believe so. You can get angry, throw a tantrum, and shout that it's not fair, but that won't change reality.

And what can we do as a society? Invest. Invest in and support efforts to tip the balance[^5] every day a little more towards those who are further behind in the race. Study scholarships are an example of this. A scholarship that not only covers tuition but ensures the person's well-being with the aim of allowing them to dedicate all the time they need to make the most of those studies.

The model of society we want[^6] is in our hands. The American [Tony Ruth](https://welcometobusinesstown.tumblr.com) reflects very well in [this illustration](https://ep01.epimg.net/verne/imagenes/2020/06/10/articulo/1591799815_274864_1591801803_media_normal.jpg) what it means to achieve a fairer society.

And what can I do as an individual? Learn. Learn to run faster. If I limit myself to moving forward running at the same pace, I'll never climb positions. How do I learn to run faster? By studying. Studying and practicing. If it's something you like, even better, the next sprint will be more rewarding.

Make no mistake, you haven't earned the place you occupy in the race. By your own merits, you will have advanced positions, I don't doubt that. But the starting point... That's nothing more than a matter of luck.

Let's keep running[^7].

[^1]: "Carrera de la vida" is a common Spanish metaphor for life's journey, similar to the English "rat race" but with less negative connotation.
[^2]: "Camino m√°s allanado o m√°s abrupto" is a metaphor describing life paths as either smoother or rougher, depending on one's circumstances.
[^3]: "Viven en una realidad paralela" is an expression suggesting that someone is out of touch with the current, commonly understood reality.
[^4]: "Meritocracia" refers to a system where positions and respect are awarded based on individual merit, talent, and achievement.
[^5]: "Decantar la balanza" is an idiom meaning "to tip the scales" or "to shift the balance", often used in contexts of decision-making or changing situations.
[^6]: "Modelo de sociedad que queremos" is a phrase often used in Spanish discourse about social and political ideals, reflecting a collective aspiration for societal improvement.
[^7]: "Sigamos corriendo" is used metaphorically to encourage perseverance and continued effort, similar to "keep pushing forward" in English.
