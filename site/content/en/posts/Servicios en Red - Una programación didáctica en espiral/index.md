**Important**: Translated automatically from Spanish by [üåêüí¨ Aphra 1.0.0](https://github.com/DavidLMS/aphra)

Following the trail of the gauntlet thrown in [this publication](https://davidlms.com/article/girando-alrededor-del-aprendizaje-una-programaci%C3%B3n-did%C3%A1ctica-en-espiral/), the time has come **to design a new curriculum**[^1] for the Network Services module[^2].

I'm going to start from the evaluation criteria of the different learning outcomes[^3], first dividing them into **conceptual** (things that students should know) and **procedural** (things that students should know how to do). Although I **prefer to make the distinction between theoretical (T) and practical (P)** directly. It may all sound very old-fashioned to you, but the conceptual and procedural terms are also outdated, and I think this way we understand each other much better. If you take a quick look at the criteria, you'll realize that categorization into one group or another is very simple. The theoretical ones **use verbs** like recognize, identify, illustrate, describe..., etc. The practical ones, on the other hand, use verbs like install, check, verify, create, configure, implement..., etc. If you disagree with any of the classified criteria **we can always discuss it**.

The other categorization is more complex, **as it is entirely subjective**. I'm referring to the weight that each criterion will have in the evaluation: basic, intermediate or advanced. If you want to know why I do it this way, you have the full explanation in [this publication](https://davidlms.com/article/evaluar-por-resultados-de-aprendizaje-y-criterios-de-evaluaci%C3%B3n-sin-morir-en-el-intento/). I've classified the installation, basic configuration, and verification of each service as a basic criterion and, therefore, minimum. A slightly more complex configuration or a concept that requires having basic knowledge of how the service works, I've classified as **intermediate**. The **advanced** criteria are those with the highest complexity and are entirely supplementary to the core requirements. This classification is completely **open to debate**, moreover, it would help me a lot if it were discussed and if all the teachers who teach the module established a similar criterion, as it would contribute to making **the evaluation fairer** regardless of the educational center where the student studies.

You have **the complete table** with all the classified criteria of the module below:

This **is the starting point**, and on this basis we will build a new curriculum design. Further details will be provided in upcoming publications.

**Update**: You now have the second publication of this series available [here](https://davidlms.com/article/servicios-en-red-una-programaci%C3%B3n-did%C3%A1ctica-en-espiral-ii/) and the conclusion [here](https://davidlms.com/article/servicios-en-red-una-programaci%C3%B3n-did%C3%A1ctica-en-espiral-y-iii/).

[^1]: "Programaci√≥n did√°ctica" refers to a comprehensive educational planning process in Spanish-speaking countries, which includes curriculum design, teaching methodologies, and assessment strategies.

[^2]: "Servicios en Red" refers to a specific module or course in the Spanish educational system focused on network services and administration.

[^3]: "Resultados de aprendizaje" is equivalent to "learning outcomes" in English-speaking educational systems and is a key component of curriculum design in Spain.
