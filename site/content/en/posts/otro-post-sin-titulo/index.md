This post has no title in its 'front matter'[^1].
The slug "otro-post-sin-titulo"[^2] should be used as the title.

[^1]: Front matter refers to the metadata section at the beginning of a document or post, typically containing information such as title, date, and tags.

[^2]: A Spanish slug meaning "another-post-without-title". Slugs are URL-friendly versions of titles, typically containing only lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens, used in web addresses to identify specific content.
