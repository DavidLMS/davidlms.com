**Important**: Translated automatically from Spanish by [üåêüí¨ Aphra 1.0.0](https://github.com/DavidLMS/aphra)

If you're a teacher or student in this field and you're not familiar with the [Apuntes FP Inform√°tica](https://apuntesfpinformatica.es/)[^1] website, you're missing out.

Tomorrow they're organizing their [I Virtual Congress ApuntesFPInformatica](https://apuntesfpinformatica.es/i-congreso/)[^2], where I contribute my grain of sand[^3], but which you should attend for the contributions of the other speakers. These types of initiatives, which aim solely to share ideas among professional peers, are rare, so let's hope they can organize many more editions.

Every day I'm more convinced that the only way to provide education with high-quality resources in this field is through sharing. The profession and the technologies used change too quickly, so we must collaborate to ensure we don't fall behind due to obsolescence[^4]. 

I'll continue to emphasize this idea in future publications. It's a necessary condition, though not sufficient on its own.

**Thank you** for reading to the end.

[^1]: Apuntes FP Inform√°tica refers to a Spanish website providing vocational training resources in computer science. FP stands for "Formaci√≥n Profesional" (Vocational Training).

[^2]: This is the "First Virtual Congress of ApuntesFPInformatica," an online event significant in Spanish vocational education for computer science.

[^3]: "Grain of sand" (granito de arena) is a common Spanish idiom meaning a small but meaningful contribution, similar to the English "drop in the bucket" but with a more positive connotation.

[^4]: "Fall behind due to obsolescence" is a translation of the Spanish idiomatic expression "nos adelante por la izquierda," which refers to being caught off guard or surpassed unexpectedly, often used in the context of staying current with developments in a field.
