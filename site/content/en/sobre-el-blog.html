This is a personal blog. And, as such, it will capture whatever I feel like writing at certain moments: reflections, tutorials, experiences, or even collaborations with other people if the opportunity arises. Therefore, I must warn you that everything expressed here reflects only an opinion at a specific moment, which may change the very next minute after its publication. It's also possible that the texts contain a large percentage of irony. I like to play with ambiguity. My deepest apologies if this aspect drives you crazy, if you can't handle cognitive dissonance or if you confuse it with inconsistency.
